# Network-Port-Scanner-using-Scapy
Developed a Python-based network scanning tool using the Scapy library to craft and send TCP packets, identify open/closed ports, and analyze responses.

Features:
Scan multiple ports on a target IP.
Detect open and closed ports.
Save output to a file (optional).

How It Works:
Crafts TCP SYN packets for each port.
Sends packets to the target host.

Analyzes responses:
SYN-ACK means the port is open.
RST-ACK means the port is closed.

Requirements:
Python
Scapy (pip install scapy)


Why Scapy means:
1.Direct Access to Network Interfaces
2.Crafting and Sending Raw Packets
3.Performing Network Scans and Sniffing
